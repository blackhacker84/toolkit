 simple Unix systems toolkit 

personal computing environments. Developed in the 1960s and 70s, UNIX is known for its stability, flexibility, and security. Here are some key characteristics of the UNIX system:

    Command-line interface: UNIX is designed to be used primarily through a command-line interface, which allows users to enter commands and perform tasks through a text-based interface.

    Multi-user and multi-tasking: UNIX is a multi-user and multi-tasking system, which means that it can support multiple users and applications running simultaneously.

    File system: UNIX uses a hierarchical file system, which organizes files and directories in a tree-like structure. This makes it easy for users to navigate and access files.

    Shell scripting: UNIX includes a powerful shell scripting language, which allows users to write scripts to automate tasks and perform complex operations.

    Open source: Many versions of UNIX are open source, which means that users can view and modify the source code of the operating system to suit their needs.

## Installation

Choose a C compiler: There are many C compilers available, including GCC, Clang, and Visual C++. Choose the one that best suits your needs and download the appropriate package for your operating system.

Install the compiler: Once you have downloaded the package, run the installer and follow the instructions to install the compiler on your system.

Set up your development environment: Depending on your needs, you may also need to install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a text editor, or other tools to help you write and debug C code.
